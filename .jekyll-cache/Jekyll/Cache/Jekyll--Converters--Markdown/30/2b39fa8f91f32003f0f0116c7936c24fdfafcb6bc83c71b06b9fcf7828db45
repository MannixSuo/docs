<p>Modularization is a big issue in today‚Äôs programing. Programmers all over
the world are trying to avoid the idea of adding code to existing classes
in order to make them support encapsulating more general information. Take
the case of a information manager which manages phone number. Phone numbers
have a particular rule on which they get generated depending on areas and
countries. If at some point the application should be changed in order to
support adding numbers from a new country, the code of the application
would have to be changed and it would become more and more complicated.</p>

<p>In order to prevent it, the Abstract Factory pattern is used. Using this
pattern a framework is defined, which produces objects that follow a
general pattern and at runtime this factory is parired with any concrete
factory to produce objects that follow the pattern of a certain country.
In other words, the Abstract Factory is a super-factory which creates other
factories(Factory of fatories);</p>

<h2 id="intent">Intent</h2>

<p>Abstract Factory offers the interface for creating a family of related
objects, without explicitly specifying their classes.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The pattern basically works as shown below, in the UML diagram:</p>

<p><img src="/pictures/pattern/abstract-factory-pattern.png" alt="abstract-factory" /></p>

<p>The classes that participate to the Abstract Factory pattern are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AbstractFactory</strong> - declaries a interface for operations that create
abstract products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ConcreteFactory</strong> - implements operations to create concrete products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AbstractProduct</strong> - declares an interface for a type of prodcut objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Product</strong> - defines a prodcut to be created by the corresponding
ConcreteFactory, it implements the AbstractProduct interface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Client</strong> - uses the interfaces declared by the AbstractFactory and
AbstractProduct classes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The AbsteractFactory class is the one that determines the actual type
of the concrete object and creates it, but it returns an abstract(not
the concrete) poniter to the concrete object just created.This determines
the behavior of the client that asks the abstract factory to create an
abstract type and to return the abstract pointer to it, keeping the client
from knowing anything about the actual creation of the object.</p>

<p>The fact that the factory returns an abstract pointer to the created object
means that the client doesn‚Äôt have knowledge of teh object‚Äôs type, the
client dealing at all times with the abstract type. The objects of the
concrete type, created by the factory, are accessed by teh clint only
through the abstract interface.</p>

<p>The second implication of this way of creating objcest is that when the
adding new concrete types is needed, all we have to do is modify the client
code and make it use a different factory, which is far easier than
instantiating a new type, which requires changing the code wherever a new
object is created.</p>

<p>The classic implementation for the Abstract Factory pattern is the following:</p>

<h2 id="applicability--examples">Applicability &amp; Examples</h2>

<p>We should use the Abstract Factory design pattern when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the system needs to be independent from the way the product it works with are
created.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the system is or should be configured to work multiple families of products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a family of peoducts is designed to work only all together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the creation of a library of products is needed, for which is relevant only
the interface not the implementation, too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pizza-factory-example">Pizza Factory Example</h2>

<p>Another example, this time more simple and easier to understand, is the one of a pizza factory, which defines method names and returns types to make different kinds of pizza. The abstract factory can be named AbstractPizzaFactory. RomeConcretePizzaFactory and MilanConcretePizzaFactory being two extensions of the abstract class. The abstract factory will define types of toppings(ÈÖçÊñô) for pizza, like pepperoni, sausage or anchovy, and the concrete factories will implement only a set of the toppings, which are specific for the area and even if one topping is implemented in both concrete factories, the resulting pizzas will be different subclasses, each for the area it was implemented in.</p>

<h2 id="specific-problems-and-implementation">Specific problems and implementation</h2>

<p>The Abstract Factory pattern has both benefits and flaws:</p>

<p>On the one hand it isolates the creation of objects from the client
that needs them, giving the client only possibility of accesing them
through an interface, which makes the manipulation easier. The
exchanging of product families is easier, as the class of a concrete
factory appears in the code only where it is instantiated. Also if the
products of a family are meant to work together, the Abstract Factory
makes it easy to use the objects from only one family at a time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, adding new products to exisiting factories is diffcult
because the Abstract Factory interface uses a fixed set of products
that can be creted. That is why adding a new prodcut would mean
extending the factory interface, which involves changes in the
AbstractFactory class and all its subclasses.</p>

<h2 id="factories-as-singletons">Factories as singletons</h2>

<p>An application usually needs only one isntance of ConcreteFactory class
per family product. This means that it is best to implement it as a
sngleton.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-products">Creating the products</h2>

<p>The AbstractFactory class only declares the interface for creating the
prodcuts. It is the task of the ConcreteProduct class to actually create the products. For each family the best idea is applying the Factory Method design pattern. A concrete factory will specify its products by overriding the factory method for each of them. Even if the implementation might seem simple, using this idea will mean defining a new concrete factory subclass for each product family, even if the classes are similar in most aspects.</p>

<p>For simplifying the code and increase the performance the Prototype design pattern can be used instead of Factory Method, especially when there are many product families. In this case the concrete factory is initiated with a prototypical instance of each product in the family and when a new one is needed instead of creating it, the existing prototype is cloned. This approach eliminates the need for a new concrete factory for each new family of products.</p>

<h2 id="extending-the-factories">Extending the factories</h2>

<p>The operation of changing a factory in order for it to support the creation of new products is not easy. What can be done to solve this problem is, instead of a CreateProduct method for each product, to use a single Create method that takes a parameter that identifies the type of product needed. This approach is more flexible, but less secure. The problem is that all the objects returned by the Create method will have the same interface, that is the one corresponding to the type returned by the Create method and the client will not always be able to correctly detect to which class the instance actually belongs.</p>

<h2 id="hot-points">Hot Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>AbstractFactory class declares only an interface for creating the products. The actual creation is the task of the ConcreteProduct classes, where a good approach is applying the Factory Method design pattern for each product of the family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extending factories can be done by using one Create method for all products and attaching information about the type of product needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
