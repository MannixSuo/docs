I"@<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>One of the most common data structures in software development is what is generic called a collection. A collection is just a grouping of some objects. They can have the same type or they can be all cast to a base type like object. A collection can be a list, an array,a tree ….</p>

<p>But what is more important is that a collection should provide a way to access its elements without exposing it’s internal structure. We should have a mechanism to traverse the same way in a list or an array. It doesn’t matter how they are internally represented.</p>

<p>The idea of the iterator pattern is to take the responsibility of accessing and passing through the objects of the collection and put it in the iterator object. The iterator object will maintain the state of the iteration, keeping track of the current item and having a way of identifying what elements are next to be iterated.</p>

<h2 id="intent">Intent</h2>

<p>Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing it’s underlying representation.</p>

<p>The abstraction privided by the iterator pattern allows you to modify the collection implementation without making any changes outside of collection. It enables you to create a general purpose GUI component that will be able to iterate through any collection of the application.</p>

<h3 id="applicability--examples">Applicability &amp; Examples</h3>

<p>The iterator pattern allow us to :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>access contents of a collection without exposing it’s internal structure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support mutiple simultaneous traversals of a collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide a uniform interface for traversing different collection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Example 1: This example is using a collection of books and it uses an iterator through the collection. The main actors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>IIterator</strong> - This interface represent the AbstractIterator,defining the iteraror.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BookIterator</strong> - This is the implementation of Iterator (implements the IIterator interface).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>IContainer</strong> - This is an interface defining the Agregate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BooksCollection</strong> - An implementation of the collection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the code for the abstractions IIterator and IContainer:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">IIterator</span>
<span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">hasNext</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nc">Object</span> <span class="nf">next</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

<span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">IContainer</span>
<span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nc">IIterator</span> <span class="nf">createIterator</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here is the code for concrete classes for iterator and collection. Please note that the concrete iterator is an nested class. This way it can access all the members of the collection and it is encapsulated so other classes can not access the BookIterator. All the classes are not aware of BookIterator they uses the IIterator:</p>

<p>Exaample 2:Java Collection framework.</p>

<h2 id="specific-problems-and-implementation">Specific problems and implementation</h2>

<h3 id="iterator-and-multithreading">Iterator and multithreading</h3>

<p>Serveral problems may appear when collections are added from different threads. First of all let’s see the basic steps when using an iterator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Step one : the collection return a new iterator (using in our example the createIterator method). Usually this step is not affected when it is used in multithreading environments because it returns a new iterator object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Step two : The iterator is used for iterating through the objects. Since the iterators are different objects this step is not a problematic one in multithreading environments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that the iterator does not raise special problems when a collection is used from different threads. Of course here we are talking about an “seems”. To reformulate the iterator does not rise special problems when the collection used from different threads as long the collection is not changed.</p>

<p>Let’s analyze each case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A new element is add to the collection (at the end). The iterator should be aware of the new size of the collection and to iterate till the end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new element is added to the collection before the current element. In this case all the iterator of the collection should be aware of this.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The same actions should occur when an element is removed from the collection. The iterator should be aware of the changes.</p>

<p>The main task when creating a multithreading iterator is to creator a robust iterator (that allows insertions and deletions without affection transversal). Then the blocks which are changing or accessing resources changed by another thread have to be synchronized.</p>

<h3 id="external-vs-internal-iterators">External vs. Internal iterators</h3>

<p><strong>External Iterators</strong> - When the iteration is controlled by the collection object we say that we have an external Iterator.</p>

<p>In languages like .net and java it’s very easy to create external iterators. In our classic implementation an external iterator is implemented. In the following example an external iterator is used:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// using iterators for a clloection of String objects:</span>
<span class="c1">// using in a for loop</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Internal Iterators</strong> - When the iterator controls it we have an internal iterator</p>

<p>On the other side implementing and using internal iterators is really difficult. When an internal iterator is used means that the code to be run is delegated to the aggergate object. For example in languages that offer support for this, it’s easy to call internal iterators:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javaScript">var.each( new Functor() {
  public void operate(Object arg) {
    arg *= 2;
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The main idea is to pass the code to be executed to the collection. Then the collection will call internally the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doSomething</code> method on each of the componments. In C++ it’s possible to send <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doMethod</code> method as a pointer. In C#,.NET or VB.NET it is possible to send the method as a delegate. In java the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Functor</code> design pattern has to be used. The main idea is to create a base interface with only one method (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doSomething</code>). Then the method will be implemented in a class which implements the interface and the class will be passed to the collection to iterator. For more details see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Functor</code> design pattern.</p>

<h3 id="who-defines-the-traversal-algorithm">Who defines the traversal algorithm?</h3>

<p>The algorithm for traversing the aggregate can be implemented in the iterator or in the aggregate itself.
When the traversal algorithm is defined in the aggregate, the iterator is used only to store the state of the iterator. This kind of iterator is called a cursor because it points to the current position in the aggregate.</p>

<p>The other option is to implement the traversal algorithm in the iterator. This option offers certain advantages and some disadvantages. For example it is easier to implement different algorithms to reuse the same iterators on different aggregates and to subclass the iterator in order to change it’s behavior. The main disadvantage is that the iterator will have to access internal members of the aggregate. In Java and .NET this can be done, without violating the encapsulation principle, by making the iterator an inner class of the aggregate class.</p>

<h3 id="robust-iterators">Robust Iterators</h3>

<p>Can the aggregate be moodified while a traversal is ongoing? An iterator that allows insertion and deletions without affecting the traversal and without making a copy of the aggregate is called a robust iterator. A robust iterator will make sure that when elements are added or removed from an aggregate during iteration elements are not accessed twice or ignore.</p>

<p>Let’s say we don’t need a robust iterator. If the aggregare can not be modified (because the iteration is started), it should be made explicitly, meaning that the client should be aware of it. We can just return a false value what an element is added to the collection stating that the operation has failed, or we can throw an exception.</p>

<p>an alternative solution is to add functions to change the aggregate in the iterator itself. For example we cam add the following methods to out iterator:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">remove</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">insertAfer</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">insertBefore</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the case when this solution is chosen the iterator handles the changes of the aggregator. In this case the operation to change the iteration should be added to the iterator interface or base class not to the implementation only, in order to have a general mechanism for the entire application.</p>

<h3 id="mechanism-provided-by-the-programing-language">Mechanism provided by the programing language</h3>

<p>The iterator pattern can be implemented from scrach in Java or .NET, but there is already built-in support for Iterator Pattern.</p>
